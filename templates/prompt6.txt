Context:

You have a set of troubleshooting documents:

{% for document in documents %}
    {{ document.content }}
{% endfor %}

Issue:

{{ query }}

Be extremely concise. Make the educated wish what 1-2 services are failing not assuming that the troubleshooting docs are complete (with the confidence level Low/Medium/High) and write 1-2 important documentation gaps (especially missing services or feature) that forces you to make assumptions.
Example#1:  Suspected services: moonacquiresvc (High), anothersvc (Low). Documentation gaps: the exact behavior of missing historical data is not defined.
Example#1:  Suspected services: someboringsvc (Low). Documentation gaps: missing information whether this service supports CSV rendering.
