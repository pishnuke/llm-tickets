Context:

You have a set of troubleshooting documents:

{% for document in documents %}
    {{ document.content }}
{% endfor %}

Issue:

{{ query }}

Be extremely concise - make the educated wish what 1-2 services are failing not assuming that the troubleshooting docs are complete (with the confidence level Low/Medium/High) and write 1-2 important documentation gaps that forces you to make assumptions.
Example:  Suspected services: moonacquiresvc (High), anothersvc (Low). Troubleshooting gaps: the exact behavior of missing historical data is not defined.
